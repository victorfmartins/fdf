# fdf
This project is in the works

fdf is about creating a simplified 3D graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in French, hence the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points (x, y, z) via segments. The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as a parameter to your program.

### What is the fdf project?
Fils de fer is the 5th project at [École 42](https://www.42sp.org.br/). It intends to devolop student skills in Imperative programming, Graphics, Rigor, Algorithms & AI. Students are expected to start their journey in graphic programming coding an “iron wire” meshing in 3D.
